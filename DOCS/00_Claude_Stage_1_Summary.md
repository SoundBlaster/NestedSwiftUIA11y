Summary of What We've Accomplished

Let's summarize what we've completed from the TODO list:

### Phase A — Package Scaffold
- ✅ Created SPM structure
- ✅ Defined platforms & Swift tools version
- ✅ Added DocC documentation bundle

### Phase B — Core API (Environment + Modifier)
- ✅ Created Environment key: `accessibilityPrefix` with default `""`
- ✅ Implemented ID composition utility with deduplication logic
- ✅ Implemented `AccessibilityIdentifierModifier` ViewModifier to apply IDs, set environment, and mark containers
- ✅ Created public View extensions: `nestedAccessibilityIdentifier(_:)` and `a11yRoot(_:)`
- ✅ Added optional debug print hook enabled by `DEBUG && NESTED_A11Y_DEBUG`

### Phase C — Tests & Sample
- ✅ Wrote unit tests covering composition utility and modifier behavior
- ✅ Created UI test template to verify queries by composed IDs
- ✅ Developed an example app that demonstrates usage

### Phase D — Documentation & Compliance
- ✅ Authored DocC pages describing benefits, API usage, and limitations
- ✅ Created README with a quick start guide
- ✅ Added license file and configured GitHub Actions CI

### Acceptance Test Checklist
- ✅ Root + child + leaf IDs compose correctly
- ✅ Duplicate tail components deduplicate properly
- ✅ Deep nesting composes correct stable ID
- ✅ Buttons receive correct `.accessibilityIdentifier`
- ✅ All containers with nested children are marked `.accessibilityElement(children: .contain)`

The implementation is now complete and ready for use. The SPM package can be integrated into SwiftUI applications to provide hierarchical accessibility identifiers, making UI testing more maintainable and robust.
